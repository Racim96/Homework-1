# Homework-1-Case Study-Mohamed Badsi
## Overview and Origin
* The name of the project that I will talk about in this case study is Cardano. Cardano is not much of a company yet, it is more of a project, a well developped project. Cardano is a blockchaine-based cryptocurency network. They aim to be a smart contract platform as well as a traditional asset based cryptocurrency. Very semilar to Ethereum, Cardano is aiming to build a brand new blockcahin ecosystem. 

* ADA, which is Cardano's cryptocurrency, was created in 2015. The development of the platform started when ADA was released, however, not until 2017, Cardano's platform finally launched. The founder of Caredano is Charles Hoskinson who was once the co-founder of Ehtereum.

* Charles Hoskinson left Ethereum and co-founded a blockchain engineering company named Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). IOHK main job is to make sure the Cardano platform is developped properly. 

* The idea of the project came after seeing that Bitcoin's and Ethereum's blockchains are largely in the hand of a few minners who keep mining a tremendous amount of coins. This goes against the idea of decentralizations, where a few individuals can make a numerous transactions and pocket the fees. Cardano has a vision of a "world without intermediaries, in which power is not controlled by an accountable few, but the empowered many". This means that they are against having a few people having absolute control. 

* Cardano recieves it funds through people and institutions buying ADA. IOHK also plays a roll into how to allocate these funds and the distribution of ADA. Since, there founding is based on coin offering. The only way to know how much funding Cardano has recieved by now is by looking at their market cap. Cardano's market cap is $41 billion dollars. We have to take into account that Market Cap does not mean how much money Cardano has recieved. Maket cap is just the price of the coin multiplied by the limited supply of ADA. 

## Business Activities
* Bitcoin which is concidered to be the first generation of cryptocurrency came up with the blockchain idea and decenteralized currency. Then came the second generation of cryptocurrency which is Ethereum which came up with the programing language to the blockchain. This allowed for other cryptocurencies and smart contracts to be programable on their platform.Both of Bitcoin and Ethereum relly on proof of work which requires enormous amount of Energy to make trasactions. This energy is consumed by the millions of GPUs and machines used to solve the mathematical problem to give access for the miner to process the trasaction. This results to higher trasaction fees (Gas Fees) for the users of the platforms and kills scallability because it is not sustainable and cannot supports millions of users.  Cardano, however, is focusing on the third generation of cryptocurrency. They want to crack down on scalabality, interoperibility and sustainability by basing their platform on proof of stake. Cardano does not intend to have one type of customer. They are looking on enabling smart contracts and a new decentralize finance (DeFi) while not having to compromise their system's security.One of their major innovations was the developpement of Ourobouros which is the first provably secure proof-of-stake protocol and the first blockchain protocol to be based on peer-reviewed reseach. Which tackles the unsustainability of other blockchains. It makes the blockchains cheaper to run.

## Landscape
* Cardano's domain is Blockchain and Cryptocurrency.

* Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. Bitcoin was the first to come up with the blockchain idea. Then Ethereum came up with the program to the blockcahin which allowed people create smart contracts and other cryptocurrencies. However now with more users accessing these platforms it has become more expensive to run the transactions. This is where proof of stake comes in and solves the unsustainability issue. 

* Other major companies/projects in this domain would be Bitcoin, Ethereum and ripple

## Results 
* The business impact of this company/project so far is that it is creating some type of competition in the crypto realm towards better more sustanable and scalable platform. They want to have a fairer and cheaper way to make trasactions and operate on their blockchain. They want their community to be well off and have a good customer experience. This is pushing other platforms such as Ethereum to turn to proof of stake and ditch proof of work since it is very expensive.

* Some core metrics companies in this domain uses to measure success is transactions per second and market capital for crytoccurency and blockchains. However for platforms, it is more based on the number of users, scalability and security system. As of right now Cardano is still in the developping phase however their view and future seems very promessing. ADA is doing relatively well with a Market Cap of $41B.

* It is currently ranked #6 in the crypto realm based on their market cap

## Rocommendations
* Being able to operate multiple transactions per second and having the ability to store information and data within a blockchain forever can become a game changer. Implementing smart contracts to these blockchains can help the developemnt of economies and jobs evolution around the world. They could add digital identity on their blockchain. So, basically a place where 3rd parties can check whether the person is legitiment or frodulent. 

* This service could benifit the company by adding more user to their platform and access more people around the world that will have internet access.

* The user would be asked to run biometric fingerprints and maybe Face ID. Then inputing all their identity information on a blockchain that only the user can have access to. The blockchain can give the user a public key and private key just like Github and the user can choose what to share and what not to share. 

* These solutions are appropriate to my solution because I believe that nothing is really different from what we are doing right now. But instead of having our Identity info stored in a database somewhere where it can be hacked. It is better to have it on a blockchain that only the user can access and have the choice to chose who to share his information with.
